Work Experience
======
**Pingyang Institute of Intelligent Manufacturing** | Dec. 2022 - Feb. 2023 <br>
Research and Development Engineer Intern | Wenzhou, China
  * Designed three elastic mechanics spatial models in ADINA with 3-/4-/6-node & polyhedral elements, achieving < 2%
error margin through iterative triangular mesh optimization around circular holes.
  * Built PLC control systems with servo motor coordination and PC-PLC communication protocols, reducing manual
intervention by 30% in production line testing scenarios.
  * Applied HIKVision Master modules for defect detection (98.7% accuracy) and QR code recognition (1300+/min through-
put), integrated equipment data via Python scripts with 500 ms latency.

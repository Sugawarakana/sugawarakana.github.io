Hello, I'm Junyu Jin and you may call me Bruce Jin!
I’m currently a Master’s student at University of Michigan, majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) and I'm expected to graduate in December 2025. I have extensive experience in ECE-related fields including artificial intelligence, computer network and security, embedded systems.
